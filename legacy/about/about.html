                <h1>Hi there :D,</h1>
                <p>My full name is Nguyen Cong Tai, born 2000.</p>
                <p>In 2018 I started my junior year in college at HUTECH University of Technology in HCM City. I majored in IT because I was once told by one of my friends that if I would ever excel in any field, it'd probably has something to do with computer :p</p>

            <div class="work">
                <div class="work-experience"></div>
                <p>However due to personal financial issues I had to drop out a year later, which in total I have just a single year in college experience. Since then I started to work part-time at local coffee shop where I gained plenty of work experience service-wise.</p>
                <p>I get to work with a lovely owner. She's had 10 years in real estate business, and opened a coffee shop for college students to work at. Its where I learned strong work ethics and time managing skill, since each staff works solo in their respective shift.</p>
            </div> 
            <img src="./coffee-shop.png" alt="coffee shop">
            <div class="currently">
                <p>Currently, I no longer work there and decided to pick up basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript in order to get employment in IT industry. Initially I went through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> Responsive Web Design course, however midway through I dropped due to the fact that they lack certain key features for JavaScript ES6, mainly and arguably the most important: Strict mode.</p>
                <p>After that I joined Wes Bos's 30 days JavaScript challenge, super comprehensive course and through that I gained more confidence in working with JavaScript and DOM! Overall after 2 months I've done a few mini projects, not much but it's what I can comfortably call mine. If you're interested in what I've build, please head over to <a href="">Projects</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/raccoonwannafly">GitHub</a>. Also <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontendmentor.io</a> is also super helpful in helping me getting more experience in front-end.</p>
